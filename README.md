# Admin Scripts

Scripts that make [tilde.institute](https://tilde.institute) work. 

Includes new user creation
and other miscellaneous tasks, such as various monitoring scripts.  

The scripts are a mixture of both `Bash` and `Python`  

Everything was written by me, except for the following, which were *not* written by me:
  * `bin/showwhoison` (written by Kneezle, the co-administrator who joined the project in March 2019)
  * `bin/newmail.sh` (same as above)
  * `bin/newuseralert.py` (same as above)
  * `bin/toot.py` (written by Ben Harris of [tilde.team](https://tilde.team))

`bin/makeuser` is originally based on [tilde.team](https://tilde.team)'s, but has been extended and modified so much it bears very little resemblance to the original.

The source code for `instistats` is at [`github.com/gbmor/instistats`](https://github.com/gbmor/instistats).
