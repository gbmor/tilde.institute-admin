# Admin Scripts

Scripts that make [tilde.institute](https://tilde.institute) work. 

Includes new user creation
and other miscellaneous tasks, such as various monitoring scripts.  

The scripts are written by gbmor, except for the following, which were *not*, but may have been committed to the repo by gbmor:
  * `bin/showwhoison` (written by Kneezle)
  * `bin/newmail.sh` (Kneezle)
  * `bin/newuseralert.py` (Kneezle)
  * `bin/newuseralertv3.py` (Kneezle)
  * `bin/toot.py` (written by Ben Harris of [tilde.team](https://tilde.team))

`bin/makeuser` is originally based on [tilde.team](https://tilde.team)'s, but has been extended and modified so much it bears very little resemblance to the original.
