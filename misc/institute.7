.Sh DESCRIPTION

Welcome to tilde.institute! This is an OpenBSD machine whose purpose is 
to provide a space in the tildeverse for experimentation with and 
education of the OpenBSD operating system. A variety of editors, shells, 
and compilers are installed to allow for development in a native OpenBSD 
environment. OpenBSD's httpd(8) is configured with slowcgi(8) as the 
fastcgi provider and sqlite3 is available. This allows users to experiment 
with web development using compiled CGI in C, aka the BCHS Stack. In 
addition to php7.0 and mysql (mariadb) by request, this provides an 
environment where the development of complex web apps is possible.
