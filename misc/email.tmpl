Hello newusername,

Your account has been activated at tilde.institute! If you have any questions, 
please feel free to email the administrators at admins@tilde.institute

Important announcements will be sent via the mailing list. Your newusername@tilde.institute

address, you can sign up here:

Don't forget to join us on IRC! The 'chat' command runs a weechat instance that
is already to set up to connect. You'll need to register your nick to speak in
the multi-tilde channel, #meta. If you prefer, catgirl, irssi and ircII are also
available, but will require manual setup. Server information is available here:

    https://wiki.tilde.institute/w/irc

There is also git repo hosting out of your home directory. For more information:

Regards,
the tilde.institute team
